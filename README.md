# Randomly
Randomly is a python desktop tkinter GUI and android application made with MIT App Inventor. Its purpose is to provide users with free, blissful entertainment. Randomly uses free API's from all around the internet to generate entertainment. Randomly can tell you jokes, advice, interesting facts, and much more! The API's the application uses are not ones I created myself, but were made and run by some generous internet strangers.

The Python and Android versions have slightly different appearances and functionalities, but they can fundamentally do the same things besides the texting functionality, which is only present on the android application.

Running the python GUI on your desktop is simple. Just download the file and run it from the command line or your favorite IDE.

Randomly Fun is available for download on the Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_ajbenz18.jokeApp, or search "Randomly Fun AJ Bensman" on the Play Store application on your phone.

The best way to view and edit the android code is by importing the .aia file into MIT App Inventor. Its free to sign up, and they allow you to create applications using some pretty simplistic drag-and-drop, block style coding.It's Very easy and User friendly.

If you find any bugs or other free web API's you'd like me to add functionality for let me know!
